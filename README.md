# Food-Recipe-Recommendation-System
A food recipe recommendation system purely based on cuisine, flavor, and diet preferences, using AVL trees and graph structures.

Problem Statement 

Design a culinary recommendation system that offers users personalized recipe suggestions tailored to their flavor preferences, preferred cuisine, and dietary restrictions. The system should employ effective algorithms to match user criteria with recipes stored in a database and deliver pertinent recommendations. Users should have the ability to engage with the system, refining their choices for more precise recipe suggestions. 

Motivation 

The reason for undertaking this project is to simplify the process of discovering recipes that suit individual preferences. Cooking is a universal activity, and many of us enjoy experimenting with new and delicious meals. However, it's often a challenge to locate recipes that align with our particular tastes, preferred cuisines, and any dietary limitations we might have. 

That's where this system comes into play. It's designed to provide recipe suggestions based on your flavor preferences and dietary restrictions, making cooking a more enjoyable experience. It helps you make informed decisions about what to cook, ultimately enhancing the overall culinary journey. 

Objectives 

These main objectives will guide the development of the recipe recommendation system: 

1. Personalized Recipe Recommendations: 

   - Create a system that offers users recipe suggestions tailored to their unique flavor preferences, cuisine choices, and dietary restrictions.
   - 
2. Efficient Matching Algorithm: 

   - Implement a robust matching algorithm to analyze user input and efficiently compare it with a comprehensive recipe database to provide highly relevant recommendations. 

3. Interactive User Interface: 

   - Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface that enables users to interact with the system, refine their preferences, and explore a diverse range of recipes easily. 

These objectives form the foundation of the project, ensuring that the system achieves its core purposes of personalization, efficiency, and user engagement.
